# 42inception
Inception is a project from the 42 curriculum focused on Docker and containerization technologies.
The goal of the project is to introduce the fundamentals of system administration by creating a multi-container Docker setup. The project requires setting up various services (such as a web server, database, and more) in isolated containers that interact with each other, simulating a real-world production environment.
